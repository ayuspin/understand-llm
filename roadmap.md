# Project Roadmap: From Math to Transformers

This roadmap outlines the journey from understanding basic matrix math to the complex architecture of modern Transformers like GPT-4.

## Phase 1: Foundations (Completed ✅)
- [x] **Vectorization**: Understanding that words are just lists of numbers.
- [x] **Linear Layers**: Matching inputs against "Weight Vectors" using Dot Products.
- [x] **Non-Linearity (ReLU)**: Why deep networks need mathematical "filters" to learn complex logic.
- [x] **Universal Function Approximation**: The theory that any complex logic can be represented as math.

## Phase 2: Sequential Understanding & Probability (Next 🚀)
- [x] **Softmax**: Turning raw scores (Logits) into clean probabilities (The "Goal Post").
- [ ] **Moving beyond "One Word at a Time"**: How to feed the model multiple words at once.
- [ ] **Context Windows**: The memory of the model.
- [ ] **Positional Encoding: Basic Concept**: "Stamping" time into word vectors via addition.
- [ ] **Positional Encoding: The Math**: Sinusoidal vs. Learned embeddings.

## Phase 3: The Attention Mechanism 🧠
- [ ] **Self-Attention**: The "Big Breakthrough." How words in a sentence "pay attention" to each other.
- [ ] **Queries, Keys, and Values**: The mathematical mechanism for selective memory.
- [ ] **Multi-Head Attention**: Learning different types of relationships simultaneously.

## Phase 4: Transformer Architecture
- [ ] **Encoder vs Decoder**: The building blocks of translation and generation.
- [ ] **Residual Connections**: Preventing math from "vanishing" as it gets deeper.
- [ ] **Layer Normalization**: Keeping the numbers stable during training.

## Phase 5: Scaling and Generation
- [ ] **Temperature and Top-K**: Controlling how "creative" or "random" the model is.
- [ ] **GPU Acceleration**: Moving from NumPy to hardware-optimized math.
- [ ] **Inference**: Scaling to billions of parameters.
